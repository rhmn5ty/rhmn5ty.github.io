            <p class="desc">Shea Whigham (American Hustle), Olivia Munn (X-Men: Apocalypse) 
                and Frank Grillo (The Grey) star in this edge of your seat, gritty crime 
                thriller. Whigham is Parker, a down on his luck social worker who finds himself 
                in over his head when he tries to protect his client from her recently paroled 
                husband. Can Parker save the family from the violent threat of the maniacal 
                drug dealer and his crew, desperate to reclaim their priceless stash at any cost?</p>
