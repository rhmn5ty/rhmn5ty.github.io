            <p class="desc">Based on true events. In an icy cold Europe, people are slowly 
                moving on after the shocking terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo. In Copenhagen, 
                the newly released criminal Omar has his own agenda. Meanwhile filmmaker Finn, 
                Jewish watchman Dan and the worn-out action force officer Rico live their various 
                everyday lives unaware of their common destiny. All of them affected by a rapidly 
                changing world while they try to make sense of their own, and too late realize that 
                life changes in an instant, fast and merciless, leaving only one of them left to 
                tell the story about the tragic attack that forever changed the country. </p>
