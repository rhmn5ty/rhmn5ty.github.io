            <p class="desc">A sci-fi thriller set in Zone 414, a dangerous, dark colony of humanoids known as 
                “the city of robots.” The colony’s creator (Fimmel) hires private investigator David Carmichael 
                (Pearce) to track down his missing daughter. David teams up with Jane (Lutz), a highly advanced 
                A.I. equipped with the same technology of her fellow humanoids, but with all the emotions, feelings 
                and dreams of a human being. They travel through the city uncovering clues and a crime that calls 
                into question the origins and true purpose behind the city of artificial humans</p>
